                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>PCOD PREDICTION.Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD) is a prevalent endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, ovarian cysts, and elevated levels of androgens. Early and accurate prediction of PCOD is crucial for timely intervention and management. This study explores the development of predictive models for PCOD using a combination of clinical data, hormonal profiles, and lifestyle factors. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines, the study evaluates the effectiveness of these models in classifying and predicting the risk of PCOD.</p>
